# Gravity Falls üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: X √Ü A-12


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sivnand V - SCMS School of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Biblically and Scientifically accurate Windows

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There was no way any one could visually see how heavy their programs were

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
See how heavy each application youve opened are. Your applications are now under the laws of physics!!
Each window you open will have a physical property and will be affected by gravity just as any object would and fall down in a scientifically accurate way.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
#### Software Used 
- Languages used: Python

- Frameworks used: None

- Libraries used:

        pygetwindow: To find and control application windows.

        threading: To run the simulation loop in the background without freezing other applications.

        ctypes: To interact with the Windows API for getting screen dimensions and checking for administrator rights.

-Tools used:

    A Python interpreter (3.10.11)
    Visual Studio Code
    Windows Command Prompt
    PowerShell
    Git Bash

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
pip install pygetwindow

# Run
python gravity.py
{Run it with admin rights if you are facing any issues}
