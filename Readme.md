# Gravity Falls üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: X √Ü A-12


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sivnand V - SCMS School of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Biblically and Scientifically accurate Windows

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There was no way any one could visually see how heavy their programs were

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
See how heavy each application youve opened are. Your applications are now under the laws of physics!!
Each window you open will have a physical property and will be affected by gravity just as any object would and fall down in a scientifically accurate way.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
#### Software Used 
- Languages used: Python

- Frameworks used: None

- Libraries used:

        pygetwindow: To find and control application windows.

        threading: To run the simulation loop in the background without freezing other applications.

        ctypes: To interact with the Windows API for getting screen dimensions and checking for administrator rights.

-Tools used:

    A Python interpreter (3.10.11)
    Visual Studio Code
    Windows Command Prompt
    PowerShell
    Git Bash

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
pip install pygetwindow

# Run
python gravity.py
{Run it with admin rights if you are facing any issues}

### Project Documentation
For Software:

The objective of the program is to give gravity to application windows, which might not be visible via photos, so please refer to the video attached. What is shown in the pictures are applications windows that are now running by a physics engine falling to the bottom of the screen. 

### Project Demo
# Video
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mfBEdLO2q7F9bDrMWuFjWnTLUfPy35he/view?usp=drive_link
In this video, when the program runs, all running windows are interpreted as physical objects, they are given a weight, which is run through a physics engine,, calculates the gravity for each element and makes them fall to the ground accordingly. When you take each of the application up and release them, they will follow the tragectory affected by gravity and recoil effect accordingly.
